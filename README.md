# Ignite Learning Paths - Train the trainer

Welcome!

The content of this repository is available for you so you can reproduce any demo or learn how to present any session of the Learning Path presented at [Microsoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite) and during [Microsoft Ignite The Tour](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/ignite-the-tour/), in your local field office, a community user group, or even as a lunch-and-learn event for your company.

## Do the Demos

If you are here to reproduce a demo in the comfort of your home/office, go in in the section [Learning Paths](#learning-paths). In each Learning Path you will find many sessions with deployment instructions, to create the environment you need, and a tutorial to do the demo step by step.

## Presenting the content

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team.

Along with the video of the presentation, this repository will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions & code.
