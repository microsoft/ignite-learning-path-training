# AIML21: Developers Guide to AI: A Data Storyâ€¯

## Train-the-Trainer Guide

### Session Abstract

In this theatre session we will show the data science process and how to apply it. From exploration of datasets to deployment of services - all applied to an interesting data story. This will also take you on a very brief tour of the Azure AI Platform.

# How to Use

### Welcome, Presenter!
